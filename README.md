Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

SOftware engineering is the process of using engineering to design, develop, release and maintain high quality software.

The importance of Software Engineering include;
1. Increase reliability and serviceability of existing software and systems in various sectors
2. Pushes the boundaries of what software, and hardware by extension, is capable of by ensuring constant innovation and improvement
3. Creates standardization of base level processes and solutions to ensure that tech progresses quickly and focuses on solutions to existing challenges
4. Creates job opportunities and ecosystems that prop up the tech industry


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Development of programming languages that enabled development
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline which enabled education programmes
3. The advent of structured programming which enabled standardization and best practices
4. The rise of agile technologies which enabled faster programming for larger and more complex projects


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements - Acquiring the project needs and requirements
2. Design - Creating detailed designs of the softawre architecture and user interface
3. Implementation - Building and developing the software
4. Testing - Ensuring the software meets the requirements for quality and function
5. Deployment - Releasing the software for use
6. Maintenance - providing support to the users and updating the software


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodologies  are a sequential approach with distinct phases where each phase is completed before progressing whereas Agile methodologies are iterative and incremental where phases are done concurrently by different developer or teams. 

Waterfall methodologies are useful where predictability and systematic development is important whereas Agule methodologies are more appropriate for flexibility and quick adaptability to change. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - writes code and implements software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures the software meets quality standards by designing tests
Project Manager - oversees the planning, development and deployment of software systems


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs provide engineers with the tools for writing, debugging and testing their code. Visual Studio Code is an example of an IDE.
VCSs provide tools for tracking changes in code and for collaboration among engineers. Git is an example of a VSC.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Changing requirements - this can be addressed by regularly assessing the goals and requirements of the projects
2. Tight deadlines - this can be addressed by prioritization of tasks and employing agile methodologies
3. Technical debt - this can be addressed by regularly testing and reviewing the code for best practices

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit testing - testing the individual components of software
2. Inegration testing - testing the interactions between different components of software 
3. System testing - testing the entire software system as a whole
4. Acceptance testing - testing the software system against user requirements and needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of crating clear and specific questions to get the best possible response from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt - Tell me about political protests.

Improved prompt - Tell me about the about the Maandamano political protests that happened in Kenya in 2024.

The improved prompt is more effective as it narrows the scope of the question to a singular specific event instead of including all possible events generally described by "political protests".
